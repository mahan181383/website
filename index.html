    <P>IM MAHAN Expository writing is one of the most common types of writing. When an author writes in an expository style, all they are trying to do is explain a concept, imparting information from themselves to a wider audience. Expository writing does not include the authorâ€™s opinions, but focuses on accepted facts about a topic, including statistics or other evidence. </P>
